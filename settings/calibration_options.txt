# Static Calibration Settings
# "#" and empty lines are ignored. "," are delimeters. format is [option_name,option_value,short description]. avoid whitespace. place string values in double quotation marks

## General
calibration_scale_factor, 2,	estimated ratio between effective stiffness at energy limit and linear stiffness
energy_overfit, 1.05,		actual_energy_limit = energy_limit * energy_overfit
force_overcalibration,1.05, 	actual_calibrated_force = calibrated_force * force_overcalibration
Static_Opts,[],			any changed static options for calibration

## Experimental
disable_calibration, 0,		turn off calibration
