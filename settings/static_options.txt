# Static Solver Settings
# "#" are ignored. "," are delimeters. format is [option_name,option_value,short description]. avoid whitespace. place string values in double quotation marks

## General
static_solver, "abaqus", 		software for apply static loadcases    
solver_algorithm, "standard",	solver algorithm to implement (e.g. continuation) 
num_loadcases, 10, 				initial target number of loadcases per SEP
maximum_loadcases, 15, 			maxium number of loadcases per SEP
minimum_displacement, 1e-16,	anything lower will be treated as zero when creating the ROM

## Abaqus
output_format, "text",			human readable data file vs binary results file (Abaqus)
maximum_step_increments, 100, 	maximum number of increments per step (Abaqus)
initial_time_increment, 1, 		initial time increment in static step (Abaqus)
total_step_time, 1, 			Estimated total step time (Abaqus) 
minimum_time_increment, 0, 		minimum time increment in static step (Abaqus)
maximum_time_increment, 1, 		maximum time increment in static step (Abaqus)

## Parallelisation
num_fe_cpus, 1, 			number of cpus available for fe software. Will use more tokens in Abaqus
max_parallel_jobs, 1, 		maximum jobs that can be submitted at once. Will use more tokens in Abaqus
minimum_job_loadcases, 10, 	minimum number of loadcases per job when submitting in parallel

## Additional Data Requests
additional_data, "none", 			additonal data to extract with each loadcase
num_validation_modes, 10, 			add the first X modes as validation modes (Perturbation)
perturbation_scale_factor, "auto", 	scale factor for perturbation load (Perturbation) 

## Experimental
load_custom_eigendata, 0,
